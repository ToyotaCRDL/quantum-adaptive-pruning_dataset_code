# quantum-adaptive-pruning_dataset_code
##### Dataset
The datasets below were used in the experiment section of the paper, "Adaptive pruning algorithm using a quantum Fisher information
matrix for parameterized quantum circuits" (Quantum Machine Intelligence, Published online: 13 November 2024). These sets were preprocessed.<br>
- data-abalone.dat<br>
- data-airfoil.dat<br>
- data-kinematics.dat<br>
- data-machine.dat<br><br>

##### Sample program as a free gift
Based on the codes from "https://github.com/txhaug/quantum-geometry," a sample program (sample.py) has been created for adaptive pruning.
This program uses a threshold for pruning and is easy to follow, allowing you to enjoy modifying it for various objectives.<br>
